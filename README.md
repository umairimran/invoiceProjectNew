## 📋 Problem & Goal: Automating Finance Operations

The traditional invoice approval process faced severe inefficiencies that threatened scalability:

* **Manual Processing Bottleneck:** Every invoice, quotation, and supporting document required time-intensive human review.
* **Error-Prone Verification:** Reviewers frequently missed subtle inconsistencies or miscalculations, leading to financial inaccuracies.
* **Scalability Issues:** The growing volume of documents from an expanding client and agency base made manual processing unsustainable.
* **Disorganized Document Handling:** Six distinct document types had to be manually matched and cross-verified for every single transaction.

🎯 **Goal:** Design and deploy an intelligent, end-to-end system to **process, extract, and verify invoice data automatically** while offering a secure, user-friendly digital approval interface.

## 💡 Solution Overview

An end-to-end **AI-powered invoice verification system** integrating intelligent document processing, a unified dashboard, and a scalable cloud-agnostic infrastructure.

## 🧠 1. AI Extraction Pipeline: Intelligent Document Processing

**Challenge:** Accurately extract and cross-validate data from diverse, multi-format documents (PDF, Excel, scanned images).

**Solution:** Built a high-performance AI pipeline utilizing **Google Gemini API** for advanced document understanding, orchestrated via a **FastAPI** backend.

**Key Capabilities:**
* **Accurate Field Extraction:** Extracts critical fields like invoice number, total amount, date, agency code, and job order ID.
* **Cross-Document Validation:** Automatically verifies consistency between the Invoice, Approved Quotation, and Timesheet documents.
* **Discrepancy Detection:** Flags and highlights any miscalculations or mismatches between source documents.
* **Format Flexibility:** Seamlessly handles structured and unstructured data across multiple file formats.

**Tech Stack:** `Python`, `FastAPI`, `Gemini API`, `PyPDF`, `Pandas`

## 🖥️ 2. User Interface: Unified Approval Dashboard

**Challenge:** Create an intuitive, multi-role interface that streamlines the review and approval process for all stakeholders.

**Solution:** Developed a modern, responsive dashboard using **Next.js 15, React, and TailwindCSS**, connected to the FastAPI API.

**Highlights:**
* **Intuitive Upload:** Drag-and-drop file upload with real-time AI processing feedback.
* **Organized View:** Folder system groups all six required document types per agency for comprehensive review.
* **Review Panel:** Side-by-side comparison of AI-extracted data versus the original document view.
* **Role-Based Access:** Customized user experience for **Admin, Reviewer, and Agency** roles.

## 📊 3. Analytics & Monitoring

**Challenge:** Provide real-time visibility into process efficiency and system accuracy.

**Solution:** Integrated an analytics dashboard to track and report key performance indicators.

**Features:**
* **Processing Metrics:** Real-time statistics for processed vs. pending invoices.
* **Efficiency Tracking:** Daily and monthly approval rates and cycle times.
* **Accuracy Improvement:** Monitoring of AI validation accuracy over time.
* **Performance Summaries:** Agency-wise breakdown of volume and efficiency.

## ☁️ 4. Scalable Infrastructure & CI/CD

**Challenge:** Ensure a highly scalable, available, and cloud-agnostic deployment with continuous quality assurance.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
Architected a modular system using industry-standard tools, designed for portability and high availability.
* **Storage:** `AWS S3` for secure and scalable document storage.
* **Compute:** `AWS EC2` for hosting the FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend.
* **Database:** `MongoDB Atlas` (or RDS option) for flexible data persistence.
* **Portability:** Fully **Dockerized Setup** ensures the application can be seamlessly moved to any cloud provider (Google Cloud, Azure).

### Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
Implemented a robust pipeline for reliable, fast, and consistent releases.
* **Quality Gates:** Automated linting and unit tests run on every code push.
* **Automation:** Build and deployment automation to staging and production environments.
* **Safety:** Rollback mechanisms for secure and immediate updates.

---

## 🔒 Security Features

Security was integrated at every layer of the architecture to protect sensitive financial data.

* **Authentication:** Secure **JWT** (JSON Web Token) authentication for all API endpoints.
* **Access Control:** Strict **Role-based access (RBAC)** ensures users only see and interact with data relevant to their role (Admin, Reviewer, Agency).
* **Validation:** Comprehensive file type and size validation on upload.
* **Protection:** Environment variable encryption and **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Document Flow

### Core Flow
Document Upload $\rightarrow$ AI Processing Pipeline (`Gemini API` + `FastAPI`) $\rightarrow$ Data Extraction & Validation $\rightarrow$ User Review & Approval (`Next.js` Dashboard) $\rightarrow$ AWS Deployment + CI/CD Automation

### Supported Document Types
The system is built to ingest and cross-verify six crucial document types:
1.  **Agency Invoice**
2.  **Approved Quotation**
3.  **Job Order**
4.  **Timesheet**
5.  **Third-Party Documents**
6.  **Proof Screenshots**
